# Sparse-Cell-Analysis-with-Lightweight-Pruned-Efficient-Layers
Scalpel is a sparse Transformer framework for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, developed as the dissertation project of Yue Bai. The framework integrates Bayesian uncertainty estimation, structured pruning, and efficient Performer-based attention to balance predictive accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.
